# Organizational Change Management (OCM) Assessment

*Use this template to document your OCM assessment for the DT project pilot. Fill this in after completing Assignment 6 (OCM Assessment), or work through it with the CHRO persona (`/chro` or `@chro`).*

## Rogers' Five Factors of Innovation Diffusion

*For each factor, rate whether it favors adoption (Yes), works against adoption (No), or is mixed (Mixed). Be honest — acknowledging challenges shows maturity and helps you plan mitigations.*

### 1. Relative Advantage

**Rating**: [ ] Yes  [ ] No  [ ] Mixed

*Is the proposed technology clearly better than what it replaces? Do stakeholders perceive the advantage?*

**Assessment**:
[Describe the relative advantage. Consider: cost savings, time savings, quality improvement, competitive edge. Is the advantage obvious to end users or only visible to management?]

**Evidence**:
[What data or examples support this? Benchmarks, case studies, pilot results from other companies?]

**If Mixed or No — Mitigation**:
[How will you demonstrate the advantage? Pilot results? Side-by-side comparisons? ROI data?]

### 2. Trialability

**Rating**: [ ] Yes  [ ] No  [ ] Mixed

*Can people try it before fully committing? Is the pilot structured to let stakeholders experiment safely?*

**Assessment**:
[Describe how your pilot enables trialability. Can users test the technology with real work? Is there a sandbox or limited rollout? Can they revert if needed?]

**Pilot Design**:
[Describe the trial scope: which users, which processes, what duration, what success criteria?]

**If Mixed or No — Mitigation**:
[How will you create opportunities for people to try before they commit? Demo days? Volunteer early adopters? Phased rollout?]

### 3. Compatibility

**Rating**: [ ] Yes  [ ] No  [ ] Mixed

*Is the technology compatible with existing systems, workflows, values, and culture?*

**Assessment**:
[Consider technical compatibility (integrates with existing systems?), process compatibility (fits current workflows?), and cultural compatibility (aligns with organizational values and norms?)]

**Integration Points**:
[List specific systems, processes, and cultural norms this technology must work with]

**If Mixed or No — Mitigation**:
[How will you address incompatibilities? Middleware? Process redesign? Cultural change initiatives?]

### 4. Observability

**Rating**: [ ] Yes  [ ] No  [ ] Mixed

*Can people see the results? Are the benefits visible to stakeholders beyond the pilot team?*

**Assessment**:
[Describe how results will be visible. Will improvements show up in dashboards, reports, or daily work? Can non-participants see the benefits?]

**Communication Plan**:
[How will you make results visible? Internal case studies? Demo sessions? Metrics dashboards? Success stories?]

**If Mixed or No — Mitigation**:
[How will you make invisible benefits tangible? Visualization tools? Regular progress reports? Testimonials from pilot users?]

### 5. Complexity

**Rating**: [ ] Yes (Low Complexity)  [ ] No (High Complexity)  [ ] Mixed

*Is the technology easy to understand and use? How steep is the learning curve?*

**Assessment**:
[Describe the complexity from the end-user perspective. How much training is needed? How different is this from current tools? What is the realistic learning curve?]

**Training Plan**:
[Outline your training approach: format, duration, audience, ongoing support]

**If Mixed or No — Mitigation**:
[How will you reduce perceived complexity? Simplified interfaces? Phased feature rollout? Dedicated support during transition? Super-user network?]

## Stakeholder Impact Assessment

*Who is affected by this change, and how?*

| Stakeholder Group | Impact Level | Primary Concern | Engagement Strategy |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| [Group 1] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Their main worry] | [How you will engage them] |
| [Group 2] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Their main worry] | [How you will engage them] |
| [Group 3] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Their main worry] | [How you will engage them] |

## Change Champions

*Who will advocate for this initiative within the organization?*

- **Executive Sponsor**: [Name/role — who provides top-down support?]
- **Change Champions**: [Which employees or managers will be early adopters and advocates?]
- **Training Leads**: [Who will deliver training and ongoing support?]

## Communication Plan

| Audience | Message | Channel | Timing |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| [Senior leadership] | [Why this matters strategically] | [Executive briefing] | [Before pilot launch] |
| [Affected employees] | [What changes, what stays the same, what support is available] | [Town hall + email] | [2 weeks before launch] |
| [IT/Technical staff] | [Technical details, support responsibilities] | [Technical briefing] | [1 month before launch] |
| [Broader organization] | [Progress updates, success stories] | [Newsletter/intranet] | [Monthly during pilot] |

## Resistance Assessment

*Be honest about where resistance will come from. "Don't delude yourself — acknowledge resistance honestly."*

| Source of Resistance | Why | Severity | Response |
|---------------------|-----|----------|----------|
| [Group/individual] | [Root cause of resistance] | [High/Medium/Low] | [How you will address it] |
| [Group/individual] | [Root cause of resistance] | [High/Medium/Low] | [How you will address it] |
