## Key Metrics

- **ROI**: [Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs x 100 = ?%]
- **Payback Period**: [Number of months until cumulative benefits exceed cumulative costs]
- **NPV** (if applicable): [Net Present Value at company's discount rate]
- **Funding Type**: [CapEx / OpEx / Both — explain classification]

## Key Assumptions

*List every major assumption behind your numbers. The CFO will scrutinize these.*

1. [Assumption 1 — e.g., "User adoption reaches 80% within 6 months"]
2. [Assumption 2 — e.g., "Cloud hosting costs remain flat at current pricing"]
3. [Assumption 3 — e.g., "Implementation completed within 4 months"]
4. [Assumption 4]
5. [Assumption 5]

## Sensitivity Analysis

*What happens to ROI if your key assumptions are wrong?*

| Scenario | Changed Assumption | Impact on ROI |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Optimistic** | [e.g., adoption at 95%] | ROI = ?% |
| **Base Case** | [Your current assumptions] | ROI = ?% |
| **Pessimistic** | [e.g., adoption at 50%] | ROI = ?% |
| **Worst Case** | [e.g., 6-month delay + low adoption] | ROI = ?% |

## Sources and Benchmarks

*Where did your numbers come from? Sourced assumptions are far more credible than guesses.*

- [Source 1 — e.g., "Gartner TCO model for SaaS implementations"]
- [Source 2 — e.g., "Company 10-K filing, revenue per employee"]
- [Source 3 — e.g., "IDC benchmark: average IoT implementation cost in manufacturing"]
