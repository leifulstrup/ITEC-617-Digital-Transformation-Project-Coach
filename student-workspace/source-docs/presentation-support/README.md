# Presentation-Day Support Files

This folder groups generated materials that support presentation delivery and judge Q&A.

## Files

- `industry-judge-analysis-and-qna.md` — likely judge questions, scoring pressure points, and response guidance
- `day-of-defense-cheat-sheet.md` — full one-page defense-day script and key numbers
- `day-of-defense-cheat-sheet-compact.md` — condensed quick-reference defense card
- `day-of-defense-speaker-split.md` — team speaker ownership and handoff plan

## Notes

- Keep core assignment/source deliverables in `student-workspace/source-docs/`.
- Keep this folder for presentation-prep support artifacts only.
- These files are generated by the simulation (via `/presentation-prep` or persona consultations). You can also create them manually.
