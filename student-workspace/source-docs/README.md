# Source Documents

Drop your existing assignment deliverables here so the AI simulation can use them as context when setting up your project brief and providing feedback.

## What to Put Here

As you complete course assignments, place copies of your deliverables in this folder:

| Assignment | What to Drop Here |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Team Charter** (Assignment 1) | Your team charter document (PDF, DOCX, or TXT) |
| **Industry & Company** (Assignment 2) | Your industry/company selection write-up |
| **Emerging Technology** (Assignment 3) | Your technology selection write-up |
| **Draft Presentation** (Assignment 4) | Place your `.pptx` in `student-workspace/slides/` instead |
| **ROI Analysis** (Assignment 5) | Your ROI spreadsheet (XLSX) or write-up |
| **OCM Assessment** (Assignment 6) | Your OCM assessment write-up |

## Supported File Types

- **PDF** (.pdf) - Preferred for written assignments
- **Word** (.docx) - Also supported
- **Text** (.txt, .md) - Plain text or markdown
- **Excel** (.xlsx) - For ROI spreadsheets and financial models

## How It Works

When you run `/setup-project` (Claude Code) or the **setup-project** prompt (Copilot), the AI will:

1. Scan this folder for any existing deliverables
2. Extract relevant information from your documents
3. Use that context to pre-fill parts of your project brief
4. Skip questions you have already answered in prior assignments
5. Focus the Q&A on what you still need to develop

## Presentation-Day Support

The `presentation-support/` subfolder holds AI-generated materials that support your presentation delivery and judge Q&A. These include:

- **Judge analysis and Q&A** — likely judge questions, scoring pressure points, and response guidance
- **Defense cheat sheet** — full one-page defense-day script and key numbers
- **Compact cheat sheet** — condensed quick-reference card
- **Speaker split** — team speaker ownership and handoff plan

These files are generated by the simulation during `/presentation-prep` or persona consultations, or you can fill in the blank templates manually. See `presentation-support/README.md` for details.

## Tips

- You do not need all assignments completed before using the simulation. Drop whatever you have so far.
- The AI adapts to your current milestone. Whether you have only a team charter or a nearly-complete proposal, it will tailor its guidance to your stage.
- Keep your original files in a safe location (OneDrive, Google Drive, etc.). These are copies for AI context.
- Presentation files (`.pptx`, `.pdf`) should go in `student-workspace/slides/`, not here.
