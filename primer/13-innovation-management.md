## Overview

Innovation management is the discipline of systematically fostering, evaluating, and scaling new ideas within an organization. It balances the need for breakthrough thinking with the realities of resource constraints, organizational inertia, and market timing.

## Design Thinking

A human-centered approach to innovation, organized in **5 stages:**

1. **Empathize** -- Deeply understand the users and their needs through observation and engagement
2. **Define** -- Clearly articulate the problem to be solved based on user insights
3. **Ideate** -- Generate a broad range of potential solutions without premature judgment
4. **Prototype** -- Build quick, low-fidelity representations of promising ideas
5. **Test** -- Put prototypes in front of users, gather feedback, and iterate

Design thinking is non-linear; teams frequently cycle back to earlier stages as they learn.

## Three Horizons Model

A portfolio approach to managing innovation across different time frames:

| Horizon | Focus | Typical Investment | Time Frame |
|---------|-------|-------------------|------------|
| **Horizon 1** | Core business optimization and extension | ~70% | Near-term (0-1 years) |
| **Horizon 2** | Emerging opportunities and adjacencies | ~20% | Medium-term (1-3 years) |
| **Horizon 3** | Transformative and disruptive bets | ~10% | Long-term (3-5+ years) |

The **70/20/10** allocation is a common guideline, not a rigid rule. The key discipline is ensuring that Horizon 1 demands do not consume all resources.

## Technology Readiness Level (TRL)

A **9-point scale** originally developed by NASA, used to assess the maturity of a technology:

| TRL | Stage |
|-----|-------|
| **TRL 1** | Basic principles observed |
| **TRL 2** | Technology concept formulated |
| **TRL 3** | Experimental proof of concept |
| **TRL 4** | Technology validated in lab |
| **TRL 5** | Technology validated in relevant environment |
| **TRL 6** | Technology demonstrated in relevant environment |
| **TRL 7** | System prototype demonstration in operational environment |
| **TRL 8** | System complete and qualified |
| **TRL 9** | Actual system proven in operational environment |

Useful for communicating technology maturity to non-technical stakeholders and for calibrating investment expectations.

## Key Innovation Theories

### Innovator's Dilemma (Clayton Christensen)

- Successful companies can fail by doing everything "right" -- listening to current customers, investing in sustaining innovations
- Disruptive innovations start in niche or low-end markets and improve until they displace incumbents
- Incumbents struggle to respond because disruptions initially look unprofitable relative to their existing business

### Rogers' Technology Adoption Lifecycle

- Describes how innovations spread through populations in a predictable pattern:
  - **Innovators** (2.5%) --> **Early Adopters** (13.5%) --> **Early Majority** (34%) --> **Late Majority** (34%) --> **Laggards** (16%)

### Moore's Crossing the Chasm

- The critical gap between **Early Adopters** and the **Early Majority**
- Many technologies fail at this transition because the needs of pragmatic buyers differ fundamentally from those of visionaries
- Crossing the chasm requires focusing on a specific beachhead market and delivering a complete solution

## Organizational Structures for Innovation

Different structures suit different innovation goals:

- **Innovation labs** -- Dedicated teams exploring new ideas outside normal operations
- **Intrapreneurship programs** -- Empowering employees to pursue entrepreneurial ideas within the company
- **Venture arms** -- Corporate venture capital investing in external startups
- **Hackathons and innovation sprints** -- Time-boxed events for rapid ideation and prototyping
- **Centers of excellence** -- Cross-functional teams that develop and share best practices

## Case Studies

### Netflix: Multi-Stage Transformation

- **Stage 1:** DVD-by-mail, disrupting Blockbuster's retail model
- **Stage 2:** Streaming video, cannibalizing its own DVD business
- **Stage 3:** Original content production, competing with Hollywood studios
- Each stage required willingness to disrupt the company's own successful business model
- Demonstrates sustained innovation through deliberate self-disruption

### Kodak vs. Fujifilm

- **Kodak** invented the digital camera but failed to commercialize it, protecting its film business
- **Fujifilm** recognized the decline of film and diversified into healthcare, cosmetics, and advanced materials
- Classic example of the Innovator's Dilemma: Kodak's strength in film became its strategic trap
- Fujifilm's willingness to leverage core competencies in new markets enabled survival and growth

## Common Pitfalls

- **Innovation theater** -- Visible innovation activities (labs, hackathons, keynotes) that produce no meaningful business outcomes; creates the appearance of innovation without substance
- **Sunk cost traps** -- Continuing to invest in failing innovation projects because of prior investment rather than future potential
- **Premature scaling** -- Scaling an innovation before product-market fit is established, consuming resources without validated demand
