# Enterprise IT Primer Reference Materials

These markdown files contain structured reference content extracted from the
[Enterprise IT Primer](https://leifulstrup.github.io/enterprise-it-primer/)
website. They serve as grounding material for the Enterprise IT Navigator
Simulation, providing the knowledge base that LLM-powered executive personas
draw upon when challenging MBA students on their Digital Transformation project
presentations.

## How These Files Are Used

Each primer section maps to one or more executive personas in the simulation.
When a simulated executive (CIO, CISO, CFO, etc.) asks questions or provides
feedback, their responses are grounded in the concepts documented here. Students
can also use these files directly as study and preparation references.
