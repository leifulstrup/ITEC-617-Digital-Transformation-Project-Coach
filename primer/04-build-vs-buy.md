## Overview

The build-vs-buy decision is one of the most consequential technology choices an organization makes. It determines cost structure, competitive differentiation, vendor dependencies, and long-term flexibility. Modern options now include subscribing to SaaS solutions, adding a third dimension to the traditional binary choice.

## Decision Framework: 8 Criteria

Organizations should evaluate build-vs-buy decisions across at least eight dimensions:

1. **Strategic differentiation** -- Does this capability provide competitive advantage?
2. **Time to market** -- How quickly is the solution needed?
3. **Internal capabilities** -- Does the organization have the skills to build and maintain it?
4. **Total cost of ownership** -- What is the full lifecycle cost of each option?
5. **Integration requirements** -- How must the solution connect with existing systems?
6. **Customization needs** -- How much must the solution be tailored to business processes?
7. **Security and compliance** -- What are the regulatory and security implications?
8. **Scalability** -- How must the solution grow with the business?

## Geoffrey Moore's Core vs. Context

A foundational framework for this decision:

- **Core** -- Activities that create competitive differentiation; candidates for **building** in-house
- **Context** -- Activities that are necessary but do not differentiate; candidates for **buying or subscribing**

The discipline is in being honest about what is truly core. Most organizations overestimate how many capabilities are genuinely differentiating.

## Weighted Scoring Matrices

- Assign weights to each decision criterion based on organizational priorities
- Score each option (build, buy, subscribe) against the criteria
- Produces a structured, defensible comparison rather than relying on gut instinct or politics

## Hidden Costs by Option

### Build (Custom Development)

- **Technical debt** accumulates over time as shortcuts are taken
- **Knowledge loss** when key developers leave the organization
- Ongoing maintenance burden that competes with new development

### Buy (COTS -- Commercial Off-the-Shelf)

- **Customization costs** to fit organizational processes
- **Upgrade cycles** that force rework of customizations
- Vendor dependency for roadmap and feature prioritization

### Subscribe (SaaS)

- **Price escalation** at renewal as switching costs increase leverage
- **Data extraction fees** and complexity when attempting to migrate away
- Limited control over feature changes, data residency, and availability

## Low-Code / No-Code Platforms

- Increasingly **blurring the boundaries** between build and buy
- Enable business users to create applications without traditional development
- Introduce new governance challenges around quality, security, and maintainability

## Common Pitfalls

- **NIH (Not Invented Here) syndrome** -- Building custom solutions when proven products exist, driven by engineering pride rather than business logic
- **Underestimating maintenance costs** -- Custom-built solutions require **15-20% of initial development cost annually** for maintenance
- **Customization trap** -- Over-customizing COTS products until they become unrecognizable and un-upgradable
