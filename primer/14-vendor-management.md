## Overview

Vendor management encompasses the full lifecycle of selecting, contracting, governing, and exiting relationships with technology suppliers. Effective vendor management reduces risk, controls costs, and ensures that external partners deliver on their commitments.

## Key Principle

**Exit planning starts during initial contracting.** Organizations that do not plan for the end of a vendor relationship at the beginning will find themselves locked in when conditions change.

## 5 Lifecycle Phases

1. **Strategy and Planning** -- Define sourcing strategy, assess internal capabilities, identify what to outsource
2. **Selection and Procurement** -- Evaluate vendors, conduct due diligence, negotiate terms
3. **Onboarding and Transition** -- Integrate the vendor into operations, establish communication and governance
4. **Performance Management** -- Monitor delivery against SLAs, manage the relationship, address issues
5. **Renewal or Exit** -- Decide whether to renew, renegotiate, or transition to an alternative

## Kraljic Matrix

A strategic framework for categorizing vendor relationships based on two dimensions: **supply risk** and **profit impact:**

| Quadrant | Supply Risk | Profit Impact | Strategy |
|----------|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Strategic** | High | High | Deep partnership, joint planning, long-term collaboration |
| **Leverage** | Low | High | Competitive bidding, exploit buying power |
| **Bottleneck** | High | Low | Secure supply, develop alternatives, reduce dependency |
| **Non-critical** | Low | Low | Simplify and automate procurement, minimize management effort |

## Procurement Instruments

| Instrument | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **RFI (Request for Information)** | Gather market intelligence and vendor capabilities; exploratory |
| **RFP (Request for Proposal)** | Solicit detailed proposals for a defined scope of work; evaluative |
| **RFQ (Request for Quote)** | Obtain pricing for well-defined requirements; competitive |

## Contract Elements

### Pricing Models

- **Fixed price** -- Predetermined cost; transfers risk to vendor
- **Time and materials** -- Pay for actual effort; transfers risk to buyer
- **Outcome-based** -- Pay for delivered results; aligns incentives but requires clear metrics
- **Subscription / per-user** -- Recurring fees based on consumption or seats

### Key Contract Provisions

- **Intellectual property (IP)** -- Ownership of work product, especially custom development
- **Data portability** -- Rights and mechanisms to extract your data during and after the relationship
- **Termination clauses** -- Conditions, notice periods, and transition assistance obligations
- **Liability and indemnification** -- Allocation of risk for breaches, failures, and third-party claims

## SLA Metrics

Service Level Agreements define measurable performance expectations:

| Metric | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Availability** | 99.9% uptime (8.76 hours of downtime per year) |
| **Availability** | 99.99% uptime (52.6 minutes of downtime per year) |
| **Availability** | 99.999% uptime (5.26 minutes of downtime per year) |
| **Response time** | P1 incidents acknowledged within 15 minutes |
| **Resolution time** | P1 incidents resolved within 4 hours |
| **Throughput** | System processes X transactions per second |

Each "nine" of availability represents a significant increase in cost and engineering complexity.

## Third-Party Risk Dimensions

Vendor relationships create risk exposure across multiple dimensions:

- **Operational risk** -- Vendor service disruptions affecting business continuity
- **Security risk** -- Vendor as an attack vector or data breach source
- **Compliance risk** -- Vendor practices violating regulatory requirements
- **Financial risk** -- Vendor insolvency or instability
- **Strategic risk** -- Over-dependence on a single vendor limiting future options
- **Concentration risk** -- Too many critical services from one provider

## Outsourcing Models

- **Staff augmentation** -- Vendor provides personnel who work under client direction
- **Managed services** -- Vendor takes responsibility for defined outcomes or functions
- **Outcome-based outsourcing** -- Vendor is compensated based on business results delivered
- **Offshore / Nearshore / Onshore** -- Geographic models with different cost, communication, and timezone trade-offs

## Vendor Lock-In Mitigation

Strategies to reduce dependency on any single vendor:

- **Use open standards and APIs** wherever possible
- **Retain data portability rights** in all contracts
- **Avoid proprietary formats** for critical data and processes
- **Maintain internal competency** to understand what the vendor does
- **Multi-vendor strategies** for critical services
- **Regular market assessments** to understand alternatives
- **Contractual exit provisions** including transition assistance and data return
