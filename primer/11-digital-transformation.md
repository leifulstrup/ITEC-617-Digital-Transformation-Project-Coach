## Overview

Digital transformation is among the most significant and most misunderstood initiatives in enterprise IT. It involves fundamental changes to how organizations create value, engage customers, and operate, enabled by technology but ultimately driven by strategy, culture, and leadership.

## Three Levels of Digital Change

Understanding the progression is critical to scoping a transformation initiative:

### 1. Digitization

- Converting analog information and processes into digital formats
- Examples: scanning paper records, moving from physical to electronic forms
- Technology-centric, relatively straightforward

### 2. Digitalization

- Using digital technologies to change existing business processes
- Examples: automating manual workflows, enabling online customer self-service
- Process-centric, requires rethinking how work gets done

### 3. Digital Transformation

- Fundamentally rethinking business models, value propositions, and organizational culture through digital capabilities
- Examples: shifting from product sales to platform-based services, creating entirely new digital revenue streams
- Strategy-centric, requires organization-wide change

## Key Frameworks

### McKinsey 4Ds

A four-phase approach to transformation:

1. **Discover** -- Identify opportunities and assess digital maturity
2. **Design** -- Define the target operating model and transformation roadmap
3. **Deliver** -- Execute initiatives with agile methods and rapid iteration
4. **De-risk** -- Manage risks through governance, change management, and portfolio management

### MIT CISR Model

Two foundational platforms for digital transformation:

- **Operational Backbone** -- Standardized, integrated systems that provide efficiency and reliability (ERP, core processes)
- **Digital Platform** -- Shared data, infrastructure, and components that enable rapid innovation and experimentation

Organizations need the operational backbone in place before they can effectively build and leverage a digital platform.

### Kotter's 8-Step Change Model

Applied to digital transformation:

1. Create a sense of urgency
2. Build a guiding coalition
3. Form a strategic vision and initiatives
4. Enlist a volunteer army
5. Enable action by removing barriers
6. Generate short-term wins
7. Sustain acceleration
8. Institute change

## Digital Maturity Models

### MIT Digital Maturity

- Assesses organizations across digital capability and leadership capability
- Four quadrants from Beginners to Digirati (high on both dimensions)

### Gartner Digital Maturity

- Multi-stage progression model for assessing transformation readiness
- Helps organizations benchmark their progress against peers

## Why ~70% of Digital Transformations Fail

The most commonly cited failure drivers:

- **Lack of clear vision** -- Technology investments without a compelling strategic narrative
- **Cultural resistance** -- Underestimating the difficulty of changing how people work
- **Insufficient leadership commitment** -- Executives who sponsor but do not actively champion the transformation
- **Talent gaps** -- Lacking the digital skills needed to execute and sustain change
- **Technology-first approach** -- Starting with technology selection rather than business problem definition

## Case Studies

### Domino's Pizza

- Transformed from a pizza delivery company into a technology company that sells pizza
- Invested heavily in digital ordering, data analytics, and customer experience
- Digital channels now account for the majority of orders
- Demonstrates successful transformation through sustained digital investment

### GE Digital -- $4 Billion Failure

- GE invested approximately **$4 billion** in its Predix industrial IoT platform
- Attempted to transform from a manufacturing conglomerate into a digital industrial company
- Failed due to overambitious scope, cultural mismatch, and execution challenges
- A cautionary tale about the risks of transformation programs that outpace organizational capacity

### DBS Bank

- Singapore-based bank that successfully transformed into a digital-first financial institution
- Reimagined customer experience, internal culture, and technology architecture simultaneously
- Won multiple "World's Best Digital Bank" recognitions
- Demonstrates that traditional financial institutions can successfully transform
