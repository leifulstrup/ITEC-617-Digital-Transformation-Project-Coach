## Overview

IT governance frameworks provide the structure for how organizations direct, monitor, and evaluate their use of information technology. Understanding the distinctions between governance and management is essential for any executive overseeing technology investments.

## Critical Distinction: Governance vs. Management

- **Governance** = Setting direction and monitoring outcomes (board-level responsibility)
- **Management** = Planning and executing against that direction (IT leadership responsibility)

Blurring this boundary is one of the most common pitfalls in enterprise IT.

## Three Pillars of IT Governance

1. **Value Delivery** -- Ensuring IT investments produce measurable business value
2. **Risk Management** -- Identifying, assessing, and mitigating technology-related risks
3. **Resource Optimization** -- Making the best use of IT assets, people, and budgets

## Major Frameworks

### COBIT 2019

- **40 governance and management objectives** organized across **5 domains**
- Provides a **capability maturity model** for assessing and improving IT processes
- Emphasizes alignment between IT goals and enterprise goals
- Well suited for organizations seeking a comprehensive governance structure

### ITIL 4

- Focused on **service delivery** and IT service management
- Built around the **Service Value System (SVS)**, which describes how organizational components work together to create value
- Defines **34 practices** spanning general management, service management, and technical management
- Widely adopted for operational IT management and service desk functions

### ISO/IEC 38500:2015

- A **board-level** governance standard for IT
- Defines **6 principles:**
  - **Responsibility** -- Individuals and groups understand and accept their responsibilities
  - **Strategy** -- IT strategy aligns with and supports business strategy
  - **Acquisition** -- IT acquisitions are made for valid reasons with proper analysis
  - **Performance** -- IT supports the organization by delivering required services
  - **Conformance** -- IT complies with all mandatory legislation and regulations
  - **Human Behavior** -- IT policies respect human factors and behavior
- Operates through an **Evaluate-Direct-Monitor** cycle that boards can apply to IT oversight

## Common Pitfalls

- **Framework overload** -- Adopting too many frameworks simultaneously without integration
- **Treating frameworks as compliance checklists** -- Focusing on box-ticking rather than genuine governance improvement
- **Blurring governance-management boundaries** -- Confusing who sets direction versus who executes
