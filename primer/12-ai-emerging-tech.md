## Overview

Artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies present both transformative opportunities and significant risks for enterprises. Leaders must navigate the hype cycle, evaluate real business value, and establish governance frameworks that enable responsible adoption.

## AI Capability Spectrum

AI encompasses a broad range of capabilities, from narrow task automation to more general reasoning:

- **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** -- Rule-based automation of repetitive tasks
- **Machine Learning** -- Systems that learn patterns from data to make predictions or classifications
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** -- Understanding and generating human language
- **Computer Vision** -- Interpreting visual information from images and video
- **Generative AI** -- Creating new content (text, images, code) based on learned patterns
- **Autonomous Systems** -- Systems that make decisions and take actions with minimal human oversight

## 5 AI Investment Questions

Before investing in AI, executives should ask:

1. **What business problem are we solving?** -- Start with the problem, not the technology
2. **Do we have the data?** -- AI requires sufficient, quality data; assess data readiness
3. **What is the expected ROI?** -- Quantify the business impact and timeline
4. **How will we govern it?** -- Define policies for responsible use from the start
5. **Do we have the talent?** -- Assess internal capabilities and external support needs

## AI Governance Framework

Responsible AI deployment requires governance across multiple dimensions:

- **Bias** -- Systematic evaluation and mitigation of unfair outcomes across protected groups
- **Transparency** -- Clear communication about when and how AI is being used
- **Explainability** -- Ability to understand and articulate why an AI system made a specific decision
- **Accountability** -- Clear ownership of AI system outcomes and their consequences
- **Privacy** -- Protection of personal data used in training and inference

## EU AI Act

- Risk-based regulatory framework classifying AI applications into tiers
- **Unacceptable risk** -- Banned (e.g., social scoring, manipulative AI)
- **High risk** -- Subject to strict requirements (e.g., AI in hiring, credit decisions, critical infrastructure)
- **Limited risk** -- Transparency obligations (e.g., chatbots must disclose they are AI)
- **Minimal risk** -- No specific obligations
- First comprehensive AI regulation globally; will influence standards worldwide

## Generative AI

### Use Cases

- Content creation and summarization
- Code generation and software development assistance
- Customer service and conversational interfaces
- Data analysis and insight generation
- Process documentation and knowledge management

### Risks

- **Hallucination** -- AI generates plausible but factually incorrect information
- **Data leakage** -- Sensitive organizational data exposed through AI interactions
- **Intellectual property** -- Unclear ownership of AI-generated content; risk of training data contamination
- **Skill erosion** -- Over-reliance on AI may degrade critical thinking and domain expertise

## AI Model Categories

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Proprietary** | Closed-source models accessed via API; highest capability, least transparency | GPT-4, Claude, Gemini |
| **Open Weights** | Model weights are published but training data and process may not be | Llama, Mistral |
| **Fully Open Source** | Weights, training data, and code are all available | OLMo, select research models |

## Deployment Options

- **API-based (Cloud)** -- Access models through vendor APIs; simplest, pay-per-use, data leaves your environment
- **Managed Private** -- Models hosted in your cloud environment; more control, higher cost
- **On-premises** -- Models run on your own infrastructure; maximum control, highest complexity and cost
- **Edge** -- Models run on devices; lowest latency, limited model size

## Other Emerging Technologies

### IoT (Internet of Things)

- Network of connected sensors and devices generating operational data
- Applications in manufacturing, logistics, facilities management, and healthcare
- Challenges: security, data volume, interoperability

### Blockchain

- Distributed ledger technology providing immutability and transparency
- Enterprise applications in supply chain provenance, digital identity, and smart contracts
- Adoption slower than initially hyped; real value in specific use cases

### Quantum Computing

- Leverages quantum mechanics for computation that is infeasible with classical computers
- Potential applications in cryptography, drug discovery, optimization, and materials science
- Still in early stages; practical enterprise applications are years away
- Near-term concern: "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks on encrypted data

## AI Maturity Stages

Organizations typically progress through stages of AI adoption:

1. **Exploring** -- Investigating use cases, running pilots
2. **Experimenting** -- Multiple proof-of-concept projects, building skills
3. **Formalizing** -- Establishing AI governance, scaling successful pilots
4. **Optimizing** -- AI embedded in core processes, continuous improvement
5. **Transforming** -- AI fundamentally reshapes business models and competitive position

## Key Insight

**As AI models commoditize, competitive advantage shifts to proprietary data.** Organizations with unique, high-quality data assets will be best positioned to derive differentiated value from AI, regardless of which models they use. The strategic focus should be on data quality, data governance, and data-driven culture rather than on model selection alone.
