## Overview

This section distills the top 10 recurring themes from industry judges who have evaluated MBA student Digital Transformation presentations from 2021 through 2024. These are real patterns from executives who reviewed proposals similar to yours. Their insights represent the gap between what students typically deliver and what senior decision-makers actually need to see.

## Theme 1: Lead with a Clear and Bold Value Proposition

Judges want to hear your core value proposition in the first three slides — not buried at the end.

- Place the "what" and "why" upfront to capture attention immediately
- Be clear and direct: "If you give me X, I will deliver Y"
- Tailor the opening to your specific audience (corporate vs. nonprofit, risk-averse vs. growth-oriented)

> **Judge Quote:** *"Put your value proposition in the first three slides... Don't wait until the end."*

**Relevant rubric dimensions:** Business Case Strength, Presentation Readiness

## Theme 2: Present Financials Early and Make Them Realistic

Sound financials build credibility. Judges expect to see ROI and cost projections early, not as an afterthought.

- Present a summary of key financial metrics (ROI, cost/benefit) early in the presentation
- Be transparent about assumptions in your financial models
- Incorporate costs beyond initial implementation: IT upgrades, licensing, ongoing training, maintenance
- Understand that "trailing costs" (maintenance, upgrades, support) are where proposals typically fall apart

> **Judge Quote:** *"I'm dying to see a traditional return on investment analysis early... Don't bury the numbers."*

**Relevant rubric dimensions:** Financial Analysis, Business Case Strength

## Theme 3: Align the Problem and Solution Clearly

A well-defined problem directly linked to a feasible solution demonstrates strategic thinking.

- State the business problem explicitly and explain why it matters
- Show how the solution addresses key pain points and stakeholder needs
- Highlight market dynamics and trends that amplify the problem's urgency

> **Judge Quote:** *"Understand what drives your customers and tailor your technology to their needs—or risk failure."*

**Relevant rubric dimensions:** Business Case Strength, Technology Selection

## Theme 4: Emphasize Depth and Credibility of Research

Thorough, well-integrated research is the backbone of an effective business case.

- Use data from reputable sources to support your recommendations
- Highlight key insights without overwhelming the audience with unnecessary details
- Integrate research findings into your narrative rather than presenting them as standalone facts

> **Judge Quote:** *"Great research and background data add credibility."*

**Relevant rubric dimensions:** Presentation Readiness (Evidence Quality)

## Theme 5: Think Big and Show Ambition

Judges prefer bold, scalable solutions that demonstrate significant value — not conservative, small-scale ideas.

- Avoid modest proposals; highlight how your solution can scale and deliver long-term impact
- Ensure big ideas are accompanied by a detailed, actionable implementation plan
- Match the scale of your ask to the scale of the opportunity

> **Judge Quote:** *"Go big or go home... If you're asking for six figures, you're not getting a call back."*

**Relevant rubric dimensions:** Business Case Strength, Financial Analysis

## Theme 6: Provide an Actionable Implementation Plan

Judges want to see how the solution will actually be implemented — not just what it will do.

- Break down the plan into phases (e.g., pilot, full rollout)
- Address potential risks and mitigation strategies upfront
- Include KPIs to measure success and accountability
- Frame parts of your proposal as low-risk "no-regret bets" to build confidence

> **Judge Quote:** *"A pilot is one way to do a no-regret bet... It's about living to fight another day."*

**Relevant rubric dimensions:** Implementation Strategy

## Theme 7: Communicate with Clarity and Visuals

Complex business cases need to be communicated in an accessible and engaging way.

- Use professional, uncluttered visuals (graphs, charts, diagrams) to reinforce key points
- Avoid jargon and overly technical language unless directly relevant to your audience
- Save detailed data for backup slides — focus on the big picture first
- Ensure smooth transitions between speakers to maintain flow

> **Judge Quote:** *"Don't talk about the mole on the Mona Lisa—talk about the whole picture first."*

**Relevant rubric dimensions:** Presentation Readiness

## Theme 8: Address Human Factors and Change Management

Technology adoption succeeds or fails based on people, not technology.

- Include a strategy for addressing employee concerns and onboarding
- Highlight how your solution will improve — not disrupt — user workflows
- Show empathy when discussing impacts on stakeholders
- Plan for resistance and build in change champions

> **Judge Quote:** *"If you don't think about how technology impacts day-to-day behavior, you're doomed to fail."*

Business is driven by people. Demonstrating EQ enhances buy-in and strengthens your proposal.

- Show how you've improved based on past lessons and feedback
