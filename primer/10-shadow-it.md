## Overview

Shadow IT refers to technology systems, solutions, and services used within an organization without explicit IT department approval. Rather than treating it purely as a threat, mature organizations recognize shadow IT as a signal of unmet business needs and develop governance strategies to manage it constructively.

## Definition

Technology acquired, deployed, or used by business units or individuals **without formal IT department knowledge or approval**. This includes SaaS subscriptions, cloud services, personal devices, unsanctioned applications, spreadsheets used as databases, and AI tools adopted informally.

## Key Statistic

**30-50% of IT spending occurs outside the formal IT budget**, highlighting the scale at which shadow IT operates in most organizations.

## Root Causes

Shadow IT emerges when legitimate business needs are not met through official channels:

- **Slow procurement processes** -- Official IT procurement takes too long relative to business urgency
- **Unmet business needs** -- IT portfolio does not address specific functional requirements
- **Consumer IT expectations** -- Users expect the ease and immediacy of consumer technology at work
- **Innovation pressure** -- Teams experiment with new tools faster than IT can evaluate and approve them
- **Departmental budgets** -- Business units can independently purchase SaaS with a credit card

## Risks

### Security

- Unapproved applications may not meet enterprise security standards
- Data may be stored in systems without proper access controls or encryption
- Increases the attack surface without IT's knowledge

### Compliance

- Regulated data may flow through unvetted systems
- Audit trail gaps when data processing occurs outside governed platforms
- Potential violations of data residency and privacy regulations

### Data Silos

- Information trapped in departmental tools is invisible to the broader organization
- Contradictory versions of truth across official and shadow systems
- Impedes enterprise analytics and reporting

### Financial Inefficiency

- Duplicate subscriptions across departments for the same or similar tools
- No volume licensing leverage when purchases are fragmented
- Wasted spend on unused or underutilized shadow tools

### Business Continuity

- No backup, disaster recovery, or support plans for unsanctioned tools
- Departure of the person who set up the tool can leave critical processes orphaned

## Governance Lifecycle

A structured approach to managing shadow IT through five phases:

1. **Discovery** -- Identify what shadow IT exists (network monitoring, expense analysis, SaaS discovery tools)
2. **Assessment** -- Evaluate each discovered tool for risk, value, and alternatives
3. **Decision** -- Approve, replace, or retire each tool based on assessment
4. **Formalization** -- Bring approved tools under IT governance (contracts, security, support)
5. **Monitoring** -- Ongoing surveillance for new shadow IT emergence

## Risk-Tiered Approval Framework

Not all shadow IT carries the same risk. A tiered approach enables faster approval for lower-risk tools:

- **Tier 1 (Low Risk)** -- Personal productivity tools with no sensitive data; streamlined self-service approval
- **Tier 2 (Medium Risk)** -- Departmental tools with business data; standard review process
- **Tier 3 (High Risk)** -- Tools processing regulated, customer, or financial data; full security and compliance review

## Governance Tools

- **CASBs (Cloud Access Security Brokers)** -- Monitor and control cloud service usage across the organization
- **SaaS management platforms** -- Discover, track, and optimize SaaS subscriptions
- **Approved application catalogs** -- Curated lists of pre-vetted tools that employees can adopt without individual approval processes
