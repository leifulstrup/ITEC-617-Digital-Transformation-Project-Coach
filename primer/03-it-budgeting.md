## Overview

IT budgeting translates technology strategy into financial commitments. Executives must understand the frameworks, allocation models, and investment evaluation techniques that drive technology spending decisions.

## Run / Grow / Transform Model

A widely used framework for categorizing IT spending:

| Category | Typical Allocation | Purpose |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| **Run** | 60-75% | Maintain current operations, keep the lights on |
| **Grow** | 15-25% | Enhance and extend existing capabilities |
| **Transform** | 10-20% | Fund new initiatives and digital transformation |

Organizations seeking competitive advantage through technology must actively manage the balance, resisting the natural tendency for "Run" spending to consume the entire budget.

## Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

- Encompasses **5 lifecycle phases**: acquisition, deployment, operation, maintenance, and retirement
- **Purchase price represents only 20-30% of total cost** -- the remaining 70-80% comes from implementation, training, support, upgrades, and eventual decommissioning
- TCO analysis is essential for accurate build-vs-buy comparisons

## CapEx vs. OpEx

- **CapEx (Capital Expenditure)** -- Upfront investments in assets (servers, data centers, software licenses)
- **OpEx (Operating Expenditure)** -- Ongoing operational costs (subscriptions, cloud services, SaaS)
- **Cloud computing shifts spending from CapEx to OpEx**, which changes how costs appear on financial statements
- **EBITDA impact** -- OpEx reduces EBITDA directly, while CapEx is depreciated over time; this distinction matters for valuations and financial covenants

## Cost Allocation Models

- **Chargeback** -- Business units are billed for their actual IT consumption; creates accountability but adds administrative complexity
- **Showback** -- Business units see their consumption costs but are not formally billed; builds awareness without billing friction
- **Direct Allocation** -- IT costs are distributed based on predetermined formulas (headcount, revenue, etc.)

## Investment Evaluation Methods

| Method | What It Measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| **ROI (Return on Investment)** | Percentage return relative to cost |
| **NPV (Net Present Value)** | Present value of future cash flows minus investment |
| **IRR (Internal Rate of Return)** | Discount rate at which NPV equals zero |
| **Payback Period** | Time required to recover the initial investment |

## Technology Business Management (TBM)

- Provides a **four-layer taxonomy** for categorizing and managing IT costs
- Enables transparency into where technology dollars are spent
- Supports conversations between IT and business leadership using shared financial language

## Industry Benchmarks: IT Spending as Percentage of Revenue

| Industry | Typical IT Spend |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Manufacturing / Retail** | 2-4% of revenue |
| **Banking / Financial Services** | 7-10% of revenue |

These benchmarks help executives assess whether their organization is investing appropriately relative to peers.
