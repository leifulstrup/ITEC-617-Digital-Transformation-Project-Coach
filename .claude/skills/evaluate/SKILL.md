# Evaluate Your DT Project Proposal

## Activation
When the user invokes /evaluate, run a comprehensive rubric evaluation.

## Instructions
1. Read the student's project brief from student-workspace/project-brief.md
2. Read presentation notes from student-workspace/presentation-notes.md (if available)
3. Read `student-workspace/roi-summary.md` if it exists and has content beyond the template — use it to inform Financial Analysis scoring
4. Read `student-workspace/ocm-assessment.md` if it exists and has content beyond the template — use it to inform Change Management scoring
5. Read all 9 rubric files from the rubrics/ directory
6. Score each of the 9 dimensions on the 1-5 scale using the criteria in each rubric file
7. For each dimension: provide score, brief justification, and specific improvements
8. Calculate composite weighted score (weights from rubrics/README.md)
9. Determine readiness level:
   - Ready to Present: 90-100%
   - Nearly Ready: 75-89%
   - Making Progress: 60-74%
   - Early Stage: 40-59%
   - Needs Rethinking: 0-39%
10. Highlight top 3 strengths and top 3 gaps
11. Recommend which executive personas to consult next based on lowest-scoring dimensions
12. Format as a clear dashboard with a summary table

## Presentation-Aware Evaluation

When presentation content is available, enhance the evaluation:

1. **Read extracted presentation** from `student-workspace/extracted/presentation-content.md`
2. **Read PDF if available** from `student-workspace/slides/*.pdf` for visual analysis
3. **Score Presentation Readiness (rubric dimension 9) based on actual slides**, not just the project brief
4. **Provide slide-specific feedback** for each rubric dimension:
   - Which slides address which rubric criteria?
   - Which criteria are NOT covered by any slide?
   - Are slides appropriately allocated across the 10-minute time limit?
5. **Visual Communication assessment**: based on slide structure, content density, and organization
6. **Speaker Notes quality**: are notes detailed enough to support a strong delivery?

## Output Format
Present results as:
- Overall Readiness Score and Level
- Summary table of all 9 dimensions with scores
- Detailed analysis per dimension
- Top strengths and gaps
- Recommended next steps with specific persona consultations
