# Dimension 3: Financial Analysis

**Composite Weight: 15%**

## Description

Evaluates the rigor and credibility of the team's financial case for the proposed pilot.
This dimension examines whether costs and benefits have been realistically estimated,
whether the ROI methodology is sound, and whether the team has considered the full
financial picture including risk-adjusted returns and funding mechanisms. Senior
executives expect financial analysis that goes beyond optimistic projections.

## Criteria

| # | Criterion | Weight | Description |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | ROI Calculation | 25% | Is there a clear, defensible ROI calculation? Are assumptions stated and reasonable? Does the methodology follow accepted practices? |
| 2 | Total Cost of Ownership | 25% | Are all cost components identified (infrastructure, licensing, personnel, training, maintenance, opportunity costs)? Is the TCO realistic for a pilot? |
| 3 | Budget Impact | 20% | How does the proposed investment fit within typical organizational budget constraints? Has the team considered CapEx vs. OpEx implications? |
| 4 | Risk-Adjusted Returns | 15% | Has the team accounted for uncertainty in their financial projections? Are scenarios (optimistic, realistic, pessimistic) presented? |
| 5 | Funding Strategy | 15% | Has the team identified how the pilot would be funded? Have they considered phased investment, internal funding mechanisms, or external funding? |

## Judge Perspective

Industry judges (2021-2024) consistently emphasize these themes related to financial analysis:

- **Present financials early** (Theme #2): *"I'm dying to see a traditional return on investment analysis early... Don't bury the numbers."* Judges expect to see ROI, cost projections, and key assumptions upfront — not as an afterthought.
- **Think big** (Theme #5): *"Go big or go home... If you're asking for six figures, you're not getting a call back."* The financial case must match the scale of the opportunity. Modest numbers signal a lack of ambition.
- **Be transparent about assumptions** (Theme #7): *"One of the expectations post-MBA is that you understand how assumptions work in financial models."* Judges value teams that show the reasoning behind their projections and present multiple scenarios.
