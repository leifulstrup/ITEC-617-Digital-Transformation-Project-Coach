# Enterprise IT Navigator Simulation - Evaluation Rubric System

## Overview

This directory contains the evaluation rubric system used by the Enterprise IT Navigator
Simulation to assess MBA student Digital Transformation project presentations. The rubric
system provides structured, multi-dimensional feedback from simulated executive personas,
helping students identify strengths and gaps before their final presentation.

## Structure

The rubric system comprises **9 evaluation dimensions** with **45 total criteria** across
all dimensions. Each dimension maps to one or more executive personas who would naturally
scrutinize that aspect of a DT proposal in a real boardroom setting.

## Scoring Scale

Each criterion is scored on a 1-5 scale:

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Not Addressed | Topic not mentioned or considered |
| 2 | Superficial | Acknowledged but lacks depth or evidence |
| 3 | Adequate | Reasonable treatment with some supporting evidence |
| 4 | Strong | Well-developed with evidence, frameworks, and analysis |
| 5 | Exceptional | Comprehensive, nuanced, with creative insights and strong evidence |

## Composite Scoring

The overall presentation score is calculated as a **weighted sum converted to a percentage**:

1. Each criterion within a dimension is scored 1-5.
2. The dimension score is the weighted average of its criteria scores.
3. The overall score is the weighted sum of all dimension scores, converted to a percentage
   of the maximum possible score.

## Readiness Levels

The composite percentage maps to a readiness level:

| Percentage | Readiness Level |
|------------|-----------------|
| 90-100% | Ready to Present |
| 75-89% | Nearly Ready |
| 60-74% | Making Progress |
| 40-59% | Early Stage |
| 0-39% | Needs Rethinking |

## Dimensions and Weights

Each dimension has a composite weight that determines how much it contributes to the
overall score. The 9 dimensions and their weights are:
