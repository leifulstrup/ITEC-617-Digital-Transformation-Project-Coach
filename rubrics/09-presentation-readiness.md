# Dimension 9: Presentation Readiness

**Composite Weight: 10%**

## Description

Assesses how well-prepared the team is to deliver a persuasive, professional presentation
to senior executive judges. This dimension goes beyond content to evaluate the team's
ability to construct a compelling narrative, support claims with evidence, anticipate
tough questions, manage their allotted time effectively, and communicate visually. Even
strong content can fail to persuade if the presentation itself is poorly structured or
delivered.

| 2 | Evidence Quality | 20% | Are claims supported by credible evidence (research, case studies, data, expert references)? Is the evidence properly cited and relevant? |
| 3 | Anticipation of Questions | 25% | Has the team prepared for likely executive questions and objections? Are potential concerns proactively addressed in the presentation? |
| 4 | Time Management | 15% | Is the presentation structured to fit within the 10-minute time limit? Is time allocated appropriately across sections? |
| 5 | Visual Communication | 20% | Are slides professional, clear, and effective? Do visuals support rather than distract from the message? Are charts, diagrams, and layouts well-designed? |

## Judge Perspective

Industry judges (2021-2024) consistently emphasize these themes related to presentation readiness:

- **Lead with the value proposition** (Theme #1): *"Put your value proposition in the first three slides... Don't wait until the end."* The opening must capture attention and convey the core strategic argument immediately.
- **Depth and credibility of research** (Theme #4): *"Great research and background data add credibility."* Claims must be backed by evidence — not assertions. Integrate research into the narrative rather than presenting standalone facts.
- **Communicate with clarity and visuals** (Theme #7): *"Don't talk about the mole on the Mona Lisa—talk about the whole picture first."* Professional visuals, clear language, and a logical flow are essential. Save detail for backup slides.
