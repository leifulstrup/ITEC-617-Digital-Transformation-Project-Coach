# Dimension 4: Risk & Security Assessment

**Composite Weight: 10%**

## Description

Examines whether the team has identified and planned for the security, privacy, and
compliance risks associated with their proposed technology initiative. In an era of
increasing cyber threats and regulatory scrutiny, executives expect DT proposals to
proactively address risk rather than treating it as an afterthought. This dimension
evaluates both the identification of threats and the quality of mitigation strategies.
