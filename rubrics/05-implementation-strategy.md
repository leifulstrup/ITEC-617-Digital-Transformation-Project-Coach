# Dimension 5: Implementation Strategy

**Composite Weight: 15%**

## Description

Assesses the team's plan for actually executing the proposed pilot. This dimension looks
at whether the team has designed a credible pilot, defined clear milestones and success
criteria, chosen an appropriate methodology, and thought ahead to how the solution could
scale beyond the pilot phase. Executives want to see that a team can move from idea to
execution with a realistic, well-structured plan.

## Related Personas

- **COO** - Evaluates operational feasibility, timeline realism, and process integration
- **CIO** - Assesses IT delivery methodology, resource planning, and enterprise scalability
- **CTO** - Reviews technical implementation approach and scalability architecture

## Criteria

| # | Criterion | Weight | Description |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Pilot Design | 25% | Is the pilot well-scoped with clear boundaries, objectives, and participant selection? Does it test the right hypotheses? |
| 2 | Timeline & Milestones | 20% | Is the implementation timeline realistic? Are milestones clearly defined with dependencies and deliverables identified? |
| 3 | Success Metrics | 20% | Are there specific, measurable KPIs to evaluate pilot success? Are baseline measurements and targets defined? |
| 4 | Methodology | 15% | Has the team selected an appropriate project management or development methodology (Agile, Waterfall, hybrid)? Is the choice justified? |
| 5 | Scalability Path | 20% | Has the team articulated how the pilot would scale to broader deployment if successful? Are scaling challenges identified? |

## Judge Perspective

Industry judges (2021-2024) consistently emphasize these themes related to implementation strategy:

- **Actionable implementation plan** (Theme #6): *"A pilot is one way to do a no-regret bet... It's about living to fight another day."* Judges want to see phased plans with clear KPIs, rollback strategies, and accountability metrics — not just a vague timeline.
- **Include KPIs and accountability** (Theme #6): *"What KPIs will you measure at the end of the pilot? Show how you'll hold yourself accountable."* Success metrics must be specific and measurable, not aspirational.
