# Dimension 6: Change Management & People

**Composite Weight: 10%**

## Description

Evaluates whether the team has considered the human side of their proposed digital
transformation initiative. Technology implementations frequently fail not because of
technical shortcomings but because of insufficient attention to organizational change.
This dimension examines stakeholder engagement, workforce readiness, communication
planning, and cultural alignment. Executives know that people challenges are often harder
than technology challenges.

## Judge Perspective

Industry judges (2021-2024) consistently emphasize these themes related to change management:

- **Address human factors** (Theme #8): *"If you don't think about how technology impacts day-to-day behavior, you're doomed to fail."* Judges consistently call out teams that ignore the people side. Change management is not optional — it's often the difference between success and failure.
- **Demonstrate emotional intelligence** (Theme #9): *"Relationships and collaboration drive success."* Show empathy for stakeholders' challenges and build communication plans that address real human concerns, not just process checklists.
