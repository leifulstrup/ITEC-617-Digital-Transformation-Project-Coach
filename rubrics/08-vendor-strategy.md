# Dimension 8: Vendor & Sourcing Strategy

**Composite Weight: 5%**

## Description

Evaluates whether the team has considered the vendor ecosystem and sourcing decisions
that underpin their proposed technology initiative. Most DT pilots involve third-party
products, platforms, or services, and executives expect teams to demonstrate due
diligence in vendor evaluation, contract structuring, risk management, and avoidance
of problematic dependencies. A sound vendor strategy protects the organization's
interests and flexibility.

| 4 | Lock-in Mitigation | 20% | Has the team addressed how to avoid or minimize vendor lock-in? Are portability, interoperability, and standards considered? |
| 5 | Pricing Model | 15% | Has the team evaluated the vendor's pricing structure (subscription, consumption-based, perpetual license)? Is the model appropriate for a pilot? |
