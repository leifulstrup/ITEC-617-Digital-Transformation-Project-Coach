# Dimension 1: Business Case Strength

**Composite Weight: 20%**

## Description

Evaluates how clearly and compellingly the team articulates the business problem, its
market context, and why the proposed solution addresses a genuine organizational need. A
strong business case demonstrates that the team understands not just the technology but
the business rationale driving the investment decision. This is the foundation upon which
all other dimensions build.

| 2 | Market/Competitive Context | 15% | Does the team demonstrate awareness of industry trends, competitive pressures, or market dynamics that make this initiative relevant? |
| 3 | Value Proposition | 25% | How compelling is the articulation of benefits? Are outcomes tied to business value (revenue, cost, efficiency, customer experience)? |
| 4 | Strategic Alignment | 20% | Does the proposal connect to broader organizational strategy, mission, or digital transformation goals? |

## Judge Perspective

Industry judges (2021-2024) consistently emphasize these themes related to business case strength:

- **Lead with the value proposition** (Theme #1): *"Put your value proposition in the first three slides... Don't wait until the end."* Judges want to see the strategic case upfront — not buried after implementation details.
- **Align problem and solution** (Theme #3): *"Understand what drives your customers and tailor your technology to their needs—or risk failure."* The strongest presentations show a clear, direct line from business pain to proposed solution.
- **Think big** (Theme #5): *"Go big or go home... If you're asking for six figures, you're not getting a call back."* Judges reward ambitious proposals that match the scale of the opportunity.
